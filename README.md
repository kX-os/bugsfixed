Hi, world.  There you can find some fixes for Debian based distros.
These 2 files qt*_1.0_all.deb are needed for some apps like FreeCad or Telegram-desktop that can't be installed from repositories due a dependency problem.
Download both files and type in a terminal:

~$ sudo dpkg -i qt*_all.deb

Tested with Ubuntu 20.04
